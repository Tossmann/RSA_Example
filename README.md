- (3) Type the secret command "copy" in and name the new contact "myself" 
- (4) Copy and save the created file "ownKeyChain.txt" to other directory for later use
- (5) Generate a new KeyChain with the command "set"
- (6) Encrypt a message with the command "en"
- (7) Then answer the question with "y" and type as a name "myself"
- (8) Now type in your Message
- (9) The Output on the Console is the Cypher, remember this cypher for later
- (10) Exchange the current File "ownKeyChain.txt" with the saved File (from Step 4)
- (11) Decrypt the message (from Step 9) with the command "de"
